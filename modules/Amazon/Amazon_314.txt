Dallas is a working mom of six. She spends her days training new employees and her evenings homeschooling her kids. “I’m proud to be working right now. I know others, especially high-risk individuals, are counting on us to deliver items they need.” Thank you and #HappyMothersDay! https://t.co/9CzfTyNoFg
