@4ur3liad @VEkpuk "My work is a true reflection of my experiences and a way for me to relate to my audience - I want my viewers to feel seen and understood. It's also a form of relief. I think life is crazy enough, I want to give people a reason to smile." - Tenbeete Solomon (@trapbob) #BHM https://t.co/R11QDzN69S
